    <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
    <p>For this project, I asked my husband to look over the website. He said for the FAQ page, to put the main body more in the middle part of the screen and make the the text easier to read. I was glad to get help on that page because I was struggling with the best way to present that content. For all of the main sections, he said to make them transparent so the background image showed through. For the History page, he suggested making the table easier to read. I was able to make most of the changes and feel like it has made the site look more polished.</p>
    <p>This learning experience on this project was really helpful because I was able to revisit all of the previous lessons and apply it hand-on. It was fun taking the content from scratch and getting the CSS to make it look better, and the creative aspect of design it however I wanted. I found it helpful to re-read the course homepage and build the pages in the order we learned the lesson. I started with the HTML structure first, then some basic CSS formatting, and then added Grid for positioning.</p>
    <p>Over the whole semester, I am glad I took this course as my elective. I'm doing the Business Information Systems degree but was more interested in the computer science side, and this taught me a lot in terms of another programming language and publishing content with GitHub.</p>
    <p>I feel like I did well on the positiong exercises and logo assignment. The ones that require more creative liberties were intimidating but I still feel proud of the end product. If I could do it differently, I would know the right order of when to add the Grid/positioning elements and how to format the CSS style page so it is more efficient.</p>
