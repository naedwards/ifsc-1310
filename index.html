    <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
    <p>For this project, I asked my husband to look over the website. He said for the FAQ page, to put the main body more in the middle part of the screen and make the the text easier to read. I was glad to get help on that page because I was struggling with the best way to present that content. For all of the main sections, he said to make them transparent so the background image showed through. For the History page, he suggested making the table easier to read. I was able to make most of the changes and feel like it has made the site look more polished.</p>
    <p>This learning experience on this project was really helpful because I was able to revisit all of the previous lessons and apply it hand-on. It was fun taking the content from scratch and getting the CSS to make it look better, and the creative aspect of design it however I wanted. I found it helpful to re-read the course homepage and build the pages in the order we learned the lesson. I started with the HTML structure first, then some basic CSS formatting, and then added Grid for positioning.</p>
    <p>Over the whole semester, I am glad I took this course as my elective. I'm doing the Business Information Systems degree but was more interested in the computer science side, and this taught me a lot in terms of another programming language and publishing content with GitHub. And also just on an individual level, I found this class really interesting since I use websites every day and have been using it for years. It made me realize it could be possible to make my own website in the future if I wanted to.</p>
    <p>I feel like I did well on the positioning exercises and logo assignment. The ones that require more creative liberties were intimidating but I still feel proud of the end product. If I could do it differently, I would know the right order of when to add the Grid/positioning elements and how to format the CSS style page so it is more efficient.</p>
    <h3>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h3>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement means having a functional and accessible website that can be used universally by the greatest number of people. This is regardless of their specific browser and can meet people at their comfort level. It focuses on the core first - Content - and builds off of that by then adding CSS style and JavaScript as "cherry on top".</p>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is important in modern web development because technology is constantly changing and we need a system of standards when it comes to formatting websites so it can easily be interfaced. It could be new browsers, new devices that have a unique screensize or UI that needs to handle sites, changes to coding and programming languages - all need to have a basic expectation of how a site is developed for ease of use. Sites need to be written for other programmers to be able to read and understand, if multiple people are working collaboratively. Also, the push for accessibility won't go away and gets more focus as time goes on. All companies looking to increase their profits are going to want to reach the most people, and that includes having an accessible website that is usable.</p>
    <p>While looking through Google I found <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/insert-clickbait-headline-about-progressive-enhancement-here/">this article</a> by the same author, Aaron Gustafson. He is responding to some criticism in <a href="https://www.viget.com/articles/the-case-against-progressive-enhancements-flimsy-moral-foundation/">another article</a> by Josh Korr on Viget.com. I found it hilarious to read the responses from both of them. Josh is making the case that "PE" is a philosophical/moral argument and less of an empirical methodology. He seems to be hung up on the whole JavaScript part or at least he says that is part of the arguments between designers. I think Josh is looking at it too deeply instead of taking the basic tenets and seeing how it could be applied in a broad aspect.</p>
